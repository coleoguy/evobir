EvobiR is a collection of functions that have proven convenient in our lab for a broad range of analyses:

- Comparative analysis of continuous traits influencing discrete states

- ABBA/BABA tests of introgression

- Tools for evaluating and measuring rate heterogeneity in Mk models

- Calculation of probabilities of sex chromosome to autosome fusions

- Counting topologies

- Working with sequence alignments

- Utility functions to ease comparative, phylogenetic, and quantitative genetic analyses
